DESCRIPTION:
This project trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 categories. After training, the model is evaluated with accuracy plots and a confusion matrix.

Loads and normalizes CIFAR-10 dataset
Builds a CNN with 3 Conv layers
Trains the model for 10 epochs
Plots accuracy & loss for training/validation
Evaluates using:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (precision, recall, F1)

Dataset: CIFAR-10
